			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/.." alt="MyPicture" style="width:200px; height:200px;">
			<p>I moved around a bit before arriving in Raleigh, NC, in the beginning of 2010. I was born and raised in Germany, but have lived in Texas, Finland and Spain. Travelling has always been a passion of mine. I love seeing new places, meeting people from all walks of life and trying new and delicious foods. 
			</p>
			<p>The best thing about strapping on your backpack with a guide book in your hand and a rough idea which places you want to see on your journey is, that there is always a surprise waiting for you while you are travelling. Be it a hidden storage room in the alleys of the bazaar in Cairo, a cafe/backyard sauna in Northern California, being chased by a monkey on a hilltop in India, or just the magnificent beauty of the Arizona desert, travelling makes you realize that the world is way less scary than most people think and you can always rely on the kindness of strangers.
